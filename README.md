## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This repo aims at creating the Udacity *Introduction to Data Science* final project.

While following the process, one is interested in answering the following questions:</br>
1. Which are the most surveyed countries by Stackoverflow in 2021 and 2022?
2. Which countries have the most professional developers surveyed in 2021/2022?
3. Given a list of popular languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Python, R, JavaScript, and PHP, which of them are the most famous among professional programmers in 2021/2022? 
4. Which of them are the most popular among professional programmers in the USA in 2021/2022?
5. Which of them are the most popular within big companies in the USA in 2021/2022?
